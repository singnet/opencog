	 * here since there are only 2 components, there is only one way to
	 * partition it.
	 *
	 * return calculate its I-surprisingness. The components are passed
	 * in order to take into account their support (which should
	 * already be stored in them), and texts in passed in order to
	 * obtain the universe count.
	 *
	 * Normalize determines whether the surprisingness is normalized
	 * according to the pattern frequency.
	 *
	 * Although mathmetically speaking partitions are sets of sets,
	 * they are encoded as lists of lists for performance reasons.
