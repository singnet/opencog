  Given a Concept node representing a rule based system for the

  rules and parameters.

  pm-rbs: Concept node of the rule-based system to configure

  mi: [optional, default=1000] Maximum number of iterations allocated.
      If negative then the pattern miner keeps running till all patterns
      have been exhausted (not recommended unless you know what you're doing).

  cp: [optional, default=1] Complexity penalty parameter passed to the forward
      chainer. It controls breadth vs depth search. A high value means more
      breadth. A value of 0 means a equilibrium between breadth and depth.
      A negative value means more depth. Possible range is (-inf, +inf)
      but it's rarely necessary in practice to go outside of [-10, 10].

  tv: [optional, default=(stv 0 1)] Truth value of a rule to expand existing
      conjunctions of patterns. It will only expand conjunctions with enough
      support with patterns with enough support. Alternatively the user can
      provide #t instead of a truth value. In that case a default true value
      will be selected.

  mc: [optional, default=3] In case tv is set to a positive strength and
      confidence, and thus incremental conjunction expansion is enabled, that
      option allows to limit the number of conjuncts to mc. If negative then
      the number of conjuncts can grow unlimited (not recommended unless you
      know what you're doing). As of now mc can not be set above 9 (which
      should be more than enough).

            (Member
              tn
              (Concept texts-name))

  ms: [optional, default=10] Minimum support. All patterns with support below
      ms are discarded. Can be a Scheme number or an Atomese number node.

  ip: [optional, default=(top)] Initial pattern to start the search from.
      All mined patterns will be specializations of this pattern.

  mi: [optional, default=1000] Maximum number of iterations allocated.
      If negative then the pattern miner keeps running till all patterns
      have been exhausted (not recommended unless you know what you're doing).

  cp: [optional, default=1] Complexity penalty parameter passed to the forward
      chainer. It controls breadth vs depth search. A high value means more
      breadth. A value of 0 means an equilibrium between breadth and depth.
      A negative value means more depth. Possible range is (-inf, +inf)
      but it's rarely necessary in practice to go outside of [-10, 10].

  tv: [optional, default=(stv 0 1)] Truth value of a rule to expand existing
      conjunctions of patterns. It will only expand conjunctions with enough
      support with patterns with enough support. Alternatively the user can
      provide #t instead of a truth value. In that case a default true value
      will be selected.

  mc: [optional, default=3] In case tv is set to a positive strength and
      confidence, and thus incremental conjunction expansion is enabled, that
      option allows to limit the number of conjuncts to mc. If negative then
      the number of conjuncts can grow unlimited (not recommended unless you
      know what you're doing). As of now mc can not be set above 9 (which
      should be more than enough).

  su: [optional, default=\"I-Surprisingness\"] After running the pattern miner,
      patterns can be ranked according to some surprisingness measure. Currently,
      only \"I-Surprisingness\" is implemented.

  Under the hood it will create a rule base and a query for the rule
  engine, configure it according to the user's options and run it.
  Everything takes place in a child atomspace. After the job is done
  it will remove the child atomspace after having copied the solution
  set in the parent atomspace.

  Pattern mining is a computationally demanding. There are three
  ways to improve performances at this time.

  1. Set ms as high as possible. The higher the minium support the
     more pruning will take place in search tree. That is because
     specializations cannot have more support than their parent
     abstraction.

  2. If it takes too long to complete, it means the search tree is
     too large to explorer entirely. Set mi to a positive value to
     halt the exploration after a certain number of iterations of
     the rule engine.

  3. If you have any idea of the kind of patterns you are looking
     for, you can provide an initial pattern, ip. All mined patterns
     will be specialized from that pattern. This can considerably
     reduce the search space as only a subtree of the whole search
     tree is considered.
